# Some Egyptian fractions

The program solves the following problem:
Given a rational number n, n >= 0, with denominator strictly positive, decompose this number as a sum of rationals with numerators equal to one and without repetitions (2/3 = 1/2 + 1/6 is correct but not 2/3 = 1/3 + 1/3, 1/3 is repeated).

The project was written in C++, can be opened via VSC.
